In the preface to Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Abelson and Sussman state

“First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
Programs are art.

This repository contains the scattered remains of LMI, Gigamos, Scheme programs, a Rebol compiler, and various other miscellany.
